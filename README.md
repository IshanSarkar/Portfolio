# My Data Analysis/Science Portfolio
I am currently in the learning phase and enrolled in a course on Data Analytics/Science and Machine Learning to become successful in this field. Regarding my highest educational background, I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering (graduated in 2018) and am currently working as a Recruiter(5+ years)/Recruitment Analyst (1+ year). Below are the projects on which I have worked during my course, aiming to provide as many insights as possible.

## Project 1: Retail Corporation Data Analysis (SQL - MySQL)
