# My Data Analysis/Science Portfolio
I am currently in the learning phase and enrolled in a course on Data Analytics/Science and Machine Learning to become successful in this field. Regarding my highest educational background, I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering (graduated in 2018) and am currently working as a Recruiter(5+ years)/Recruitment Analyst (1+ year). Below are the projects on which I have worked during my course, aiming to provide as many insights as possible.

## Project 1: Retail Corporation Data Analysis 
**(SQL - MySQL | Tableau)**
### Business Problem:
To analyze the given dataset to extract valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations about 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. The dataset offers a comprehensive view of various dimensions including the order status, price, payment and freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. The information can shed light on various aspects of the business, such as order processing, pricing strategies, payment and shipping efficiency, customer demographics, product characteristics, and customer satisfaction levels.

## Project 5: Data Analysis of Multinational Retail Corporation 
**(Python - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Math, Scipy.stats.norm)**
### Primary Topic: Central Limit Theorem and Confidence Interval
### Business Problem:
The Management team of the company wants to analyze the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers and so on.

## Project 6: Data Analysis of Electrical-Bike-Rental-Company 
**(Python - numPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats (ttest_ind, f_oneway, shapiro, levene, kruskal, chi2_contingency, pearsonr, spearmanr), statsmodels.graphics.gofplots - qqplot)**
### Primary Topic: Hypothesis Testing
### Business Problem:
The company wants to identify which variables play significant roles in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles in the market. By determining the key variables influencing demand, the company can prioritize resources and strategic initiatives to optimize their business operations and meet customer needs effectively.<br>
Additionally, the company aims to evaluate how well these identified variables describe the demand for electric cycles. Understanding the descriptive power of these variables will provide insights into the factors driving consumer behavior and preferences in the market, enabling the company to tailor its offerings and marketing strategies accordingly.
