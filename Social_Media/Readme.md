## Project 4: Average Time and Various Aspects Of People Spending Time On Social Media (Python - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)<br>
### About Dataset:<br>
This is dummy data, that has been generated by using the 'NumPy' Library of Python. This data shows how much a user spends time on their devices using Social Media.<br><br>

#### Data Overview: <br>

**Analysis:** <br>
- There’s a balanced gender distribution indicating diversity in this particular dataset or population.<br>
- Instagram’s popularity suggests that visual content might be more engaging for this audience.<br>
- A significant interest in lifestyle and travel indicates potential markets for products or services in these sectors.<br>

**Analysis:** <br>
- The age graph suggests that there are two age groups, around 20 and 50 years old, that stand out in the count. The reason for this could be varied and would need further investigation.<br>
- The time spent graph indicates that there’s a drop in counts after 2 units of time spent. This could suggest that people tend to spend less time after a certain point, but then some people spend a lot more time, as indicated by the rise at around 6 units.<br>
- The income graph shows that there’s an increase in counts as income rises to around 14000, suggesting that this income level is quite common. However, it then drops and rises again at around 18000, indicating another common income level.<br>

**Analysis:** <br>
- There’s a strong positive correlation between age and income. This suggests that as people get older, their income tends to increase. This could be due to factors like career progression and accumulation of experience.<br>
- There’s a strong positive correlation between time spent and being in debt. This could indicate that the more time people spend on Social Media, the more likely they are to incur debt.<br> - This might be related to spending habits or lifestyle choices.<br>
- There’s a notable correlation between income and being a homeowner. This suggests that higher income levels could lead to higher rates of home ownership.<br>
- There’s a correlation between being in debt and owning a car. This could be due to the costs associated with car ownership, such as loans, maintenance, and insurance.<br>

#### Demographics Analysis

**Analysis:** <br>
- The chart represents the age distribution by gender in three different locations: United Kingdom, Australia, and United States. It appears that the age distribution is fairly similar across all three locations for each gender.<br>
- The chart includes data for males, females, and non-binary individuals. This suggests a diverse representation of genders in the data.<br>
- The chart allows for a comparison of age distributions across different locations. This could be useful for understanding demographic differences or similarities between these locations.<br>

**Analysis:** <br>
- The chart represents the age distribution across three different professions: Software Engineer, Student, and Marketer Manager. It appears that Students are generally younger than Software Engineers and Marketer Managers. This is consistent with the expectation that people often start as students before moving into professional roles.<br>
- The age distributions for these professions are similar across the three locations: United Kingdom, Australia, and United States. This suggests that the age profiles for these professions are not significantly influenced by location.<br>
- Among the professions, Marketer Managers tend to be older than Software Engineers, which could be due to the different career paths and progression rates in these fields.<br>

**Insights:** <br>
- The graph represents the count of demographics (Urban, Sub-Urban, and Rural) across three social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) in different locations (United Kingdom, Australia, United States). Instagram appears to have a higher user count across all demographics and locations compared to Facebook and YouTube.<br>
**Analysis:** <br>
- The Urban demographic dominates in all platforms and locations except for YouTube in the United States where Sub-Urban is highest. This could suggest that urban areas have better internet accessibility or lifestyle differences that make social media usage more prevalent.<br>
- Instagram seems to be more popular among a broader audience, which could be due to its user-friendly interface, visual content, or other factors.<br>

**Insights:** <br>
- The graph represents the count of different genders (male, female, non-binary) across three social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) in different locations (United Kingdom, Australia, United States). Instagram appears to have a higher user count across all genders and locations compared to Facebook and YouTube.<br>
**Analysis:** <br>

**Trends and Patterns:** <br>
- Consistent Age Distribution Across Locations and Genders: This suggests that age demographics may not vary significantly across these regions within the studied genders.<br>
- Consistent Age Profiles for Professions Across Locations: The age distributions for the professions are similar across the three locations, suggesting that age profiles for these professions are not significantly influenced by location.<br>
- Urban areas dominate in all platforms and locations, except for YouTube in the United States, where the Sub-Urban demographic is highest.<br>
- Instagram appears to be popular among a broader audience compared to Facebook and YouTube.<br>
- Each platform (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) exhibits distinct gender demographics across the studied locations, indicating varying preferences or usage patterns among different user groups. For example, Instagram's user base in the United Kingdom is dominated by females, while YouTube's user base in the United States is predominantly non-binary.<br>
